This repository offers guidance and support for users to plan and implement their research studies using ISARIC's Clinical Epidemiology Platform. We will continue to add new folders in this repository for emerging disease outbreaks, with a webpage for each.

Currently, we have
- Mpox Research Response Guidance at [https://isaricresearch.github.io/Responses/Mpox](https://isaricresearch.github.io/Responses/Mpox)
- H5Nx Research Response Guidance at [https://isaricresearch.github.io/Responses/H5Nx](https://isaricresearch.github.io/Responses/H5Nx)
